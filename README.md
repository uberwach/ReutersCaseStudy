# Reuters Case Study
My submission for the second round of the 2014's <a href="http://texata.com">Texata</a> for the curious ones. We got two data sets provided by Thomson Reuters: (1) Earning calls logs (i. e. analysts talk with representatives of a business about its state) and (2) Company M&A.

I worked on (1) doing a sentiment analysis on what every analyst says by using a neural network based model of the Stanford's NLP group (was very new during that time). There is quite some hazzle integrating this part programmatically, where I wrote a wrote an Adapter in Java for. The rest of the code is mainly data ingestion and transforming into (Speaker, Spoken Text, Sentiment). There was no time left for further analysis on top of that.

The total round had 4 hours and consisted out of this case study and some - rather easy - questions regarding data analysis in general (that took 0.5 out of the 4 hrs).
